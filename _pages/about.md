About me
======


Hi! I'm a math PhD candidate at New York University's [Courant Institute](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/). I am interested in the application of probability and stochastic analysis to diverse problems. So far, this interest has taken me in two research directions. <br>

## <strong> The Continuum Limit of Interacting Particle Systems</strong><br>

Together with <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/">Jonathan Weare</a> (my advisor at Courant), <a href="https://marzuola.web.unc.edu/">Jeremy Marzuola</a> at UNC Chapel Hill, and other collaborators, I have been studying interacting particle system models for particle diffusion on a crystal surface. The overarching question is the following: given a stochastic process governing this diffusion on a microscopic level, can we derive an equation for the collective, macroscopic motion of particles by "zooming out" on this microscopic dynamics? We have approached this problem using a blend of numerical simulation and probabilistic analysis.

##  <strong>Low SNR Gaussian Mixture Models</strong><br>

  My second research direction is in the mathematics of data science. <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/">Afonso Bandeira</a> (my second advisor, now at ETH) and I study statistical inference for Gaussian mixture models in the regime of vanishing separation between mixture centers. This regime is of particular interest in applications such as cryo-electron microscopy, in which the mixture centers are known to enjoy additional structure: they are related to each other by the action of a group. We have been exploring the surprising intimate connection between log likelihood maximization algorithms such as EM, and the method of moments, in this regime.
