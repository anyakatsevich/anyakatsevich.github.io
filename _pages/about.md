About me
======


Hello! I'm a postdoc in the [math](https://math.mit.edu/) department at MIT working with [Philippe Rigollet](https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/), and am also affiliated with [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/). I obtained my PhD at the [Courant Institute](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at NYU, where I worked with <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/">Jonathan Weare</a> and <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/">Afonso Bandeira</a> (now at ETH). 

My current research is on the theory of high-dimensional Bayesian inference and on how the theory informs computational methods. In graduate school, I worked on discrete-to-continuum limits of interacting particle systems and on inference in low SNR Gaussian mixture models.
