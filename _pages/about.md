About me
======


Hello! I'm an incoming assistant professor in Statistical Science at Duke. Previously, I was a postdoc in the math department at MIT and before that, I obtained my PhD in math at the Courant Institute at NYU.
<!--in the [math](https://math.mit.edu/) department at MIT working with [Philippe Rigollet](https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/), and am also affiliated with [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/). I obtained my PhD at the [Courant Institute](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at NYU, where I worked with <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/">Jonathan Weare</a> and <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/">Afonso Bandeira</a> (now at ETH).-->

My research is on the theory of high-dimensional Bayesian inference and on how the theory informs computational methods. 
<!--In graduate school, I worked on discrete-to-continuum limits of interacting particle systems and on inference in low SNR Gaussian mixture models.-->
